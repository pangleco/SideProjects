       "'There is only a 5% chance that the Earth will avoid warming by at least 2C come the end of the century, according to new research that paints a sobering picture of the international effort to stem dangerous climate change. Global trends in the economy, emissions and population growth make it extremely unlikely that the planet will remain below the 2C threshold set out in the Paris climate agreement in 2015, the study states. The Paris accord, signed by 195 countries, commits to holding the average global temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and sets a more aspirational goal to limit warming to 1.5C. This latter target is barely plausible, the new research finds, with just a 1% chance that temperatures will rise by less than 1.5C. Were closer to the margin than we think, said Adrian Raftery, a University of Washington academic who led the research, published in Nature Climate Change. If we want to avoid 2C, we have very little time left. The public should be very concerned. Governments settled on the 2C threshold partly through political expediency but also because scientists have warned of severe consequences from sea level rise, drought, heatwaves and social unrest should the temperature rise beyond this.  Such risks have been underscored by a separate study, also released on Monday, that shows unabated climate change will cause around 60,000 deaths globally in 2030 and 260,000 deaths by 2100. The study, by the University of North Carolina, found that rising temperatures will exacerbate air pollutants that will particularly threaten those with existing conditions.  According to the University of Washington study, there is a 90% likelihood that temperatures will rise between 2C and 4.9C by 2100. This would put the world in the mid-range warming scenarios mapped out by the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It negates the most optimistic outcome as well as the worst case, which would see temperatures climb nearly 6C beyond the pre-industrial era. Rather than look at how greenhouse gases will influence temperature, the new research analyzed the past 50 years of trends in world population, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted for each dollar of economic activity. After building a statistical model covering a range of emissions scenarios, the researchers found that carbon intensity will be a crucial factor in future warming. Technological advances are expected to cut global carbon intensity by 90% over the course of the century, with sharp declines in China and India two newly voracious consumers of energy. However, this decline still will not be steep enough to avoid breaching the 2C limit.  The worlds population is expected to grow to about 11 billion people by 2100, but the research found that this will have a relatively small impact upon temperatures as much of this growth will take place in sub-Saharan Africa, which is a minor contributor of greenhouse gas emissions. It has long been acknowledged that emissions cuts promised under the the Paris agreement would not be sufficient to avoid 2C warming. However, it is hoped that periodic reviews of commitments will result in more severe reductions. Donald Trumps pledge to remove the US, the worlds second-largest emitter, from the accord has cast a large shadow over these ambitions.  Even if the 2C target isnt met, action is very important, said Raftery. The more the temperature increases, the worse the impacts will be. We would warn against any tendency to use our results to say that we wont avoid 2C, and so its too late to do anything. On the contrary, avoiding the higher temperature increases that our model envisages is even more important, and also requires urgent action. Raftery acknowledged that a breakthrough technology could dramatically change the outlook but noted that major advances of the past 50 years, such as the computer, robotics, hybrid cars, the internet and electronic fuel injection, have improved carbon efficiency steadily at around 2% a year, rather than in huge jumps. Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University who was not involved in the study, said the researchs conclusions were reasonable but said it was difficult to assign a precise probability to future temperature rises. I agree that staying below 2C and 1.5C are unlikely and very, very unlikely, respectively, he said. But this research gives a false sense of rigor. Tomorrow someone could invent a carbon-free energy source that everyone adopts. If you look at technology adoption and action taken on the ozone layer and acid rain, its clear these things can change faster than people predict. Dessler said the falling cost of renewable energy would be a major factor in reducing emissions but further impetus would be needed through new actions such as a price on carbon.  Its like youre driving and about to collide with the car in front of you, he said. You want to hit the brakes as fast as you can. The later you wait, the more painful its going to be. John Sterman, an academic at the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative, said the research was an urgent call to action. MIT research has shown that emissions cuts in the Paris agreement would stave off around 1C of temperature increase by 2100 findings misrepresented by Trump when he announced the US departure from the pact. Sterman said the US must dramatically speed the deployment of renewable energy and especially energy efficiency. Fortunately, renewables, storage and other technologies are already cheaper than fossil energy in many places and costs are falling fast. More aggressive policies are urgently needed, but this study should not be taken as evidence that nothing can be done.'"

The work focused on an inherited form of heart disease, but scientists believe the same approach could work for other conditions caused by single gene mutations, such as cystic fibrosis and certain kinds of breast cancer. Humans have two copies of every gene, but some diseases are caused by a mutation in only one of the copies. Today, people who carry certain genetic diseases can opt for IVF and have their embryos screened for harmful mutations. Its unclear when wed be allowed to move on. If all of this holds up for different genes and is also true when the mutation is inherited from the mother, it will be a major step forward, said Janet Rossant, senior scientist and chief of research emeritus at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. Asked about the potential for gene editing to produce designer babies, Rossant, a co-author of the NAS report on gene editing, said it was a distant prospect. Even if we did, a genetic alteration that enhanced one trait could have unexpected negative consequences on other traits, and this would be an inherited feature for the next generation.?The NAS report came out strongly against any form of gene editing designed to simply enhance human potential, she added.\n",

This Google RailTel initiative was launched in January 2016 and till date has reached 140 stations across India. Very relevant in today's time. What we have seen is that as 4G has emerged, we have seen no dip in the Wi-Fi usage. The railway station is a great point of convergence. The mark of telecommunication development of any country is how close the Fiber is to the user. In effect, you must see that the Wi-Fi that we are implementing is an attempt to bring Fiber close to the user. And that is working pretty well for us. Q: During my interactions with passengers and workers at the Nizzamudin railway station, I found out that many of them feel that during peak hours the speed slows down quite a bit. The average usage still remains 350MB per user per session which shows we have augmented the network and capacity while adding more users. Q: But what is the minimum speed - I spoke to many people and got a lot of varying replies. It is also measured by the latency of the network. If you compare this with Wi-Fi in London and San Francisco, you will find that the Wi-Fi is better in both coverage and capacityNote: The network is dynamically adjusted in such a way that priority is given to those who are logging in for the first time.

Indian agencies are concerned that the Pakistan-funded terror groups are roping in youngsters for their mission. The pace at which these developmental projects are coming up is worrying for India. China's \"development\" projects\" in PoK and neighbouring Gilgit-Baltistan that involve several thousand Chinese personnel belonging to the construction corps of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) point towards Beijing's expansionist geo-strategic agenda in the region. So far, residents have not been employed in construction work, except some security personnel who have been engaged for protection of Chinese workers. With the reported stationing of a unit of PLA soldiers near the Khunjerab Pass and Chinese military officials frequenting the field command office of Gilgit, which happens to be Pakistan's military headquarters in the region, a pervasive Chinese intent of establishing a military edge in India's northern sector cannot be negated, observers say.\n",

It has been decided to celebrate the festival of Rakshabandhan on August 7. In this connection, all offices/ departments shall remain open and celebrate the festival collectively at a suitable time wherein all the lady staff shall tie rakhis to their colleagues, the order, issued on August 1 by Gurpreet Singh, deputy secretary (personnel), had said. To ensure that no one skipped office, an attendance report was to be sent to the government the next evening. The two notifications one mandating the celebration of Rakshabandhan (left) and the other withdrawing the mandate (right) were issued by the Daman and Diu administration a day apart. The circular was withdrawn through a one-line order issued late in the evening by the UTs department of personnel and administrative reforms. The circular is ridiculous. There are sensitivities involved. How can the government dictate who I should tie rakhi to? We should maintain the professionalism of a workplace an official told Hindustan Times earlier in the day. She refused to be identified. The notice was issued on Daman and Diu administrator and former Gujarat home minister Praful Kodabhai Patels direction, sources said. Rakshabandhan, a celebration of the bond between brothers and sisters, is one of several Hindu festivities and rituals that are no longer confined of private, family affairs but have become tools to push politic al ideologies. In 2014, the year BJP stormed to power at the Centre, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat said the festival had national significance and should be celebrated widely to protect Hindu culture and live by the values enshrined in it. The RSS is the ideological parent of the ruling BJP. Last year, women ministers in the Modi government went to the border areas to celebrate the festival with soldiers. A year before, all cabinet ministers were asked to go to their constituencies for the festival.'"

       "'There is only a 5% chance that the Earth will avoid warming by at least 2C come the end of the century, according to new research that paints a sobering picture of the international effort to stem dangerous climate change. Global trends in the economy, emissions and population growth make it extremely unlikely that the planet will remain below the 2C threshold set out in the Paris climate agreement in 2015, the study states. The Paris accord, signed by 195 countries, commits to holding the average global temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and sets a more aspirational goal to limit warming to 1.5C. This latter target is barely plausible, the new research finds, with just a 1% chance that temperatures will rise by less than 1.5C. Were closer to the margin than we think, said Adrian Raftery, a University of Washington academic who led the research, published in Nature Climate Change. If we want to avoid 2C, we have very little time left. The public should be very concerned. Governments settled on the 2C threshold partly through political expediency but also because scientists have warned of severe consequences from sea level rise, drought, heatwaves and social unrest should the temperature rise beyond this.  Such risks have been underscored by a separate study, also released on Monday, that shows unabated climate change will cause around 60,000 deaths globally in 2030 and 260,000 deaths by 2100. The study, by the University of North Carolina, found that rising temperatures will exacerbate air pollutants that will particularly threaten those with existing conditions.  According to the University of Washington study, there is a 90% likelihood that temperatures will rise between 2C and 4.9C by 2100. This would put the world in the mid-range warming scenarios mapped out by the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It negates the most optimistic outcome as well as the worst case, which would see temperatures climb nearly 6C beyond the pre-industrial era. Rather than look at how greenhouse gases will influence temperature, the new research analyzed the past 50 years of trends in world population, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted for each dollar of economic activity. After building a statistical model covering a range of emissions scenarios, the researchers found that carbon intensity will be a crucial factor in future warming. Technological advances are expected to cut global carbon intensity by 90% over the course of the century, with sharp declines in China and India two newly voracious consumers of energy. However, this decline still will not be steep enough to avoid breaching the 2C limit.  The worlds population is expected to grow to about 11 billion people by 2100, but the research found that this will have a relatively small impact upon temperatures as much of this growth will take place in sub-Saharan Africa, which is a minor contributor of greenhouse gas emissions. It has long been acknowledged that emissions cuts promised under the the Paris agreement would not be sufficient to avoid 2C warming. However, it is hoped that periodic reviews of commitments will result in more severe reductions. Donald Trumps pledge to remove the US, the worlds second-largest emitter, from the accord has cast a large shadow over these ambitions.  Even if the 2C target isnt met, action is very important, said Raftery. The more the temperature increases, the worse the impacts will be. We would warn against any tendency to use our results to say that we wont avoid 2C, and so its too late to do anything. On the contrary, avoiding the higher temperature increases that our model envisages is even more important, and also requires urgent action. Raftery acknowledged that a breakthrough technology could dramatically change the outlook but noted that major advances of the past 50 years, such as the computer, robotics, hybrid cars, the internet and electronic fuel injection, have improved carbon efficiency steadily at around 2% a year, rather than in huge jumps. Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University who was not involved in the study, said the researchs conclusions were reasonable but said it was difficult to assign a precise probability to future temperature rises. I agree that staying below 2C and 1.5C are unlikely and very, very unlikely, respectively, he said. But this research gives a false sense of rigor. Tomorrow someone could invent a carbon-free energy source that everyone adopts. If you look at technology adoption and action taken on the ozone layer and acid rain, its clear these things can change faster than people predict. Dessler said the falling cost of renewable energy would be a major factor in reducing emissions but further impetus would be needed through new actions such as a price on carbon.  Its like youre driving and about to collide with the car in front of you, he said. You want to hit the brakes as fast as you can. The later you wait, the more painful its going to be. John Sterman, an academic at the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative, said the research was an urgent call to action. MIT research has shown that emissions cuts in the Paris agreement would stave off around 1C of temperature increase by 2100 findings misrepresented by Trump when he announced the US departure from the pact. Sterman said the US must dramatically speed the deployment of renewable energy and especially energy efficiency. Fortunately, renewables, storage and other technologies are already cheaper than fossil energy in many places and costs are falling fast. More aggressive policies are urgently needed, but this study should not be taken as evidence that nothing can be done.'"
